## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Contract Structure

```
PaymentAgent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contracts/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PaymentCronTransactionHandler.cdc    # Main contract with Handler resource
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transactions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InitPaymentCronTransactionHandler.cdc # Initialize handler (one-time setup)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SchedulePaymentCron.cdc               # Schedule recurring payments

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GetPaymentCronStatus.cdc              # Query payment status
```

### Key Components

#### 1. PaymentCronTransactionHandler Contract

The main contract containing:
- **Handler Resource**: Implements `FlowTransactionScheduler.TransactionHandler` interface
- **PaymentCronConfig Struct**: Encapsulates payment configuration and state
- **Events**: `PaymentExecuted` and `PaymentCronCompleted` for monitoring

#### 2. Transactions

- **InitPaymentCronTransactionHandler**: One-time setup to create and store the Handler resource
- **SchedulePaymentCron**: Schedule a new recurring payment job
- **CancelPaymentCron**: Cancel an existing scheduled payment and get refund

#### 3. Scripts

- **GetPaymentCronStatus**: Query all scheduled payments for an account

### Data Flow

```
1. User sends SchedulePaymentCron transaction
   ‚Üì
2. Transaction validates balance and recipient
   ‚Üì
3. Handler resource schedules payment with FlowTransactionScheduler
   ‚Üì
4. Scheduled transaction executes at specified intervals
   ‚Üì
5. Handler.executeTransaction() is called by scheduler
   ‚Üì
6. Payment is sent to recipient
   ‚Üì
7. Next execution is scheduled (if not completed)
   ‚Üì
8. PaymentExecuted event is emitted
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Flow CLI 2.7.1+ (required for scheduled transactions support)
- Flow account with FLOW tokens
- Emulator or Testnet access

### 3-Step Setup

#### Step 1: Deploy Contract

```bash
# Start emulator (if testing locally)
flow emulator

# Deploy to emulator
flow project deploy --network=emulator

# Or deploy to testnet
flow project deploy --network=testnet
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Handler

```bash
# Emulator
flow transactions send \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/transactions/InitPaymentCronTransactionHandler.cdc \
  --network=emulator \
  --signer=emulator-account

# Testnet
flow transactions send \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/transactions/InitPaymentCronTransactionHandler.cdc \
  --network=testnet \
  --signer=your-account
```

#### Step 3: Schedule Your First Payment

```bash
# Send 1 FLOW daily for 7 days
flow transactions send \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/transactions/SchedulePaymentCron.cdc \
  0xRECIPIENT_ADDRESS \
  1.0 \
  86400.0 \
  1 \
  1000 \
  7 \
  null \
  --network=emulator \
  --signer=emulator-account
```

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Project Setup

Ensure your `flow.json` includes the PaymentAgent contract:

```json
{
  "contracts": {
    "PaymentCronTransactionHandler": {
      "source": "cadence/PaymentAgent/contracts/PaymentCronTransactionHandler.cdc"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Dependencies

The contract requires these Flow standard contracts (already in `flow.json`):
- `FlowTransactionScheduler`
- `FlowTransactionSchedulerUtils`
- `FlowToken`
- `FungibleToken`

### 3. Network Configuration

Verify network aliases in `flow.json`:
- **Emulator**: `127.0.0.1:3569`
- **Testnet**: `access.devnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000`
- **Mainnet**: `access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000`

## üìñ Usage

### Initialization (One-Time Setup)

Before scheduling payments, initialize the handler in your account:

```bash
flow transactions send \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/transactions/InitPaymentCronTransactionHandler.cdc \
  --network=testnet \
  --signer=your-account
```

This transaction:
- Creates a `Handler` resource
- Stores it in `/storage/PaymentCronTransactionHandler`
- Publishes a capability at `/public/PaymentCronTransactionHandler`

### Scheduling Payments

#### Basic Syntax

```bash
flow transactions send \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/transactions/SchedulePaymentCron.cdc \
  <recipientAddress> \
  <paymentAmount> \
  <intervalSeconds> \
  <priority> \
  <executionEffort> \
  <maxExecutions> \
  <baseTimestamp> \
  --network=<network> \
  --signer=<signer>
```

#### Parameters

## üîç Monitoring

### Check Payment Status

Query all scheduled payments for your account:

```bash
flow scripts execute \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/scripts/GetPaymentCronStatus.cdc \
  0xYOUR_ADDRESS \
  --network=testnet
```

The script returns:
- Transaction IDs
- Recipient addresses
- Payment amounts
- Execution counts
- Next execution times
- Completion status

### Watch Payment Events

Monitor payment executions in real-time:

```bash
# View PaymentExecuted events
flow events get \
  A.YOUR_ADDRESS.PaymentCronTransactionHandler.PaymentExecuted \
  --last 200 \
  --network=testnet

# View completion events
flow events get \
  A.YOUR_ADDRESS.PaymentCronTransactionHandler.PaymentCronCompleted \
  --last 200 \
  --network=testnet
```

### Event Structure

#### PaymentExecuted Event

```cadence
access(all) event PaymentExecuted(
    transactionId: UInt64,
    executionNumber: UInt64,
    recipient: Address,
    amount: UFix64,
    nextExecutionTime: UFix64?
)
```

#### PaymentCronCompleted Event

```cadence
access(all) event PaymentCronCompleted(executionCount: UInt64)
```

## üõë Canceling Payments

Cancel a scheduled payment and receive a partial fee refund:

```bash
flow transactions send \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/transactions/CancelPaymentCron.cdc \
  <TRANSACTION_ID> \
  --network=testnet \
  --signer=your-account
```

**Note**: You'll receive approximately 50% refund of the fees paid when canceling.

## üß™ Testing

### Automated Testing

For automated emulator testing, use the test script (if available):

```bash
# On Git Bash/WSL (Windows)
./cadence/PaymentAgent/TEST-PAYMENT-EMULATOR.sh
```

### Manual Testing Workflow

```bash
flow emulator
```

#### 2. Deploy Contracts

```bash
flow project deploy --network=emulator
```

#### 3. Initialize Handler

```bash
flow transactions send \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/transactions/InitPaymentCronTransactionHandler.cdc \
  --network=emulator \
  --signer=emulator-account
```

#### 4. Schedule Test Payment

```bash
# Small test payment: 0.001 FLOW every 60 seconds, 3 times
flow transactions send \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/transactions/SchedulePaymentCron.cdc \
  0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7 \
  0.001 \
  60.0 \
  1 \
  1000 \
  3 \
  null \
  --network=emulator \
  --signer=emulator-account
```

#### 5. Check Status

```bash
flow scripts execute \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/scripts/GetPaymentCronStatus.cdc \
  0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7 \
  --network=emulator
```

#### 6. Monitor Events

```bash
flow events get \
  A.f8d6e0586b0a20c7.PaymentCronTransactionHandler.PaymentExecuted \
  --last 50 \
  --network=emulator
```

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy to emulator successfully
- [ ] Initialize handler without errors
- [ ] Schedule payment with valid parameters
- [ ] Verify payment executes at scheduled time
- [ ] Check events are emitted correctly
- [ ] Query status returns correct information
- [ ] Cancel payment and verify refund
- [ ] Test with insufficient balance (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Test with invalid recipient (should fail gracefully)

## üö¢ Deployment

### Deployment Workflow

#### 1. Emulator Testing

Always test thoroughly on emulator first:

```bash
flow emulator
flow project deploy --network=emulator
# Run all tests...
```

#### 2. Testnet Deployment

After successful emulator testing:

```bash
# Deploy to testnet
flow project deploy --network=testnet --update

# Initialize handler on testnet
flow transactions send \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/transactions/InitPaymentCronTransactionHandler.cdc \
  --network=testnet \
  --signer=testnet-account

# Test with small amounts
# Monitor closely for first few executions
```

#### 3. Mainnet Deployment

Before deploying to mainnet:

- [ ] Complete security audit
- [ ] Review all contract code
- [ ] Test extensively on testnet
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are correct
- [ ] Ensure sufficient FLOW for fees

```bash
flow project deploy --network=mainnet --update
```

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All contracts compile without errors
- [ ] Tested extensively on emulator
- [ ] Tested on testnet with real transactions
- [ ] All edge cases tested
- [ ] Documentation reviewed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Flow.json configured correctly
- [ ] Account has sufficient FLOW

## üîí Security

### Security Features

- **Capability-Based Access**: Uses Flow capabilities for secure access control
- **Balance Validation**: Pre-flight checks prevent insufficient balance errors
- **Recipient Validation**: Verifies recipient can receive tokens before scheduling
- **Pre-Conditions**: Contract-level validation of all parameters
- **Resource Management**: Proper resource lifecycle management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages prevent silent failures

### Best Practices

1. **Always test on emulator first** - Never deploy directly to mainnet
2. **Start with small amounts** - Verify behavior before scaling up
3. **Monitor your balance** - Ensure sufficient FLOW for all scheduled payments
4. **Verify recipient addresses** - Double-check addresses before scheduling
5. **Use Medium priority** - Best balance of cost and reliability
6. **Set max executions** - Prevent unintended account drainage
7. **Keep transaction receipts** - Store transaction IDs for cancellation
8. **Monitor events** - Watch for unexpected behavior

### Known Limitations

- **Fixed Intervals**: Cannot change interval after scheduling (must cancel and reschedule)
- **Fixed Amount**: Payment amount cannot be changed after scheduling
- **Single Recipient**: Each job pays only one recipient
- **Network Dependent**: Execution timing depends on network conditions
- **No Partial Refunds**: Cancellation refunds full fee minus overhead, not pro-rated

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Error: "Payment Cron Transaction Handler not initialized"

**Solution**: Run `InitPaymentCronTransactionHandler.cdc` first. This is a one-time setup per account.

```bash
flow transactions send \
  cadence/PaymentAgent/transactions/InitPaymentCronTransactionHandler.cdc \
  --network=testnet \
  --signer=your-account
```

#### Error: "Insufficient FLOW balance"

**Solution**: Ensure your account has enough FLOW to cover:
- All payment amounts
- Transaction fees
- Scheduling fees
- Recommended 10% buffer

#### Error: "Recipient account does not have a valid FlowToken receiver"

**Solution**: The recipient must have:
- Flow account set up
- FlowToken vault configured
- Public receiver capability at `/public/flowTokenReceiver`

Ask the recipient to set up their Flow account properly before scheduling payments.

#### Linter Errors in IDE

You may see import errors like:
```
cannot find type in this scope: FlowTransactionScheduler
```

**This is normal!** The contracts are deployed on testnet/mainnet (see `flow.json` dependencies). The code will work correctly when you run transactions. The IDE linter cannot resolve contracts deployed on-chain.

#### Payment Not Executing

**Check**:
1. Verify payment is scheduled: `GetPaymentCronStatus.cdc`
2. Check account balance is sufficient
3. Verify recipient can receive tokens
4. Check network status
5. Review priority level (Low priority may have delays)
6. Check events for error messages

#### Cancellation Not Working

**Check**:
1. Verify transaction ID is correct
2. Ensure payment hasn't already completed
3. Check you're the owner of the scheduled payment
4. Verify sufficient balance for cancellation fee

### Getting Help

1. **Check Documentation**: Review all documentation files in `cadence/PaymentAgent/`
2. **Test on Emulator**: Reproduce issue on emulator for easier debugging
3. **Review Events**: Check event logs for error details
4. **Flow Discord**: Join https://discord.gg/flow for community support
5. **Flow Docs**: See https://developers.flow.com/build/advanced-concepts/scheduled-transactions

## üí∞ Fees and Costs

### Fee Structure

Scheduled transactions have different fees based on priority:

| Priority | Fee Multiplier | Estimated Cost |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| High (0) | 10x base fee | Highest cost |
| Medium (1) | 5x base fee | Recommended |
| Low (2) | 2x base fee | Lowest cost |

### Cost Example

For 7 daily payments of 1 FLOW with Medium priority:

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Payments (7 √ó 1.0 FLOW) | 7.0 FLOW |
| Scheduling Fee | ~0.001 FLOW |
| Storage Fee | ~0.0001 FLOW |
| **Total** | **~7.0011 FLOW** |

### Fee Refunds

When canceling a scheduled payment:
- Approximately 50% of fees are refunded
- Payment amounts are not refunded (only fees)
- Storage costs are not refunded

## üìö API Reference

## üéì Key Implementation Details

### Critical Fix Applied

The Payment Agent implementation includes required metadata view functions that are essential for compilation:

```cadence
access(all) view fun getViews(): [Type] {
    return [Type<StoragePath>(), Type<PublicPath>()]
}

access(all) fun resolveView(_ view: Type): AnyStruct? {
    switch view {
        case Type<StoragePath>():
            return /storage/PaymentCronTransactionHandler
        case Type<PublicPath>():
            return /public/PaymentCronTransactionHandler
        default:
            return nil
    }
}
```

These functions are required by the `FlowTransactionScheduler.TransactionHandler` interface and enable:
- Metadata discovery by tools and explorers
- Standardized querying of handler information
- Integration with Flow ecosystem tools

See `PAYMENT-CRON-IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md` for complete technical details.
